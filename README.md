## Development Environment

All code was written and tested in an environment suitable for the book's practical exercises:

- Programming languages: Python
- Socket programming for client-server communication
- Packet analysis using tools such as **Wireshark** and **Scapy**

This setup is designed to align with the book’s hands-on approach to understanding networking concepts.
